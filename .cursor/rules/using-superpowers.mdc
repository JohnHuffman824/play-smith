<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a rule might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read the rule.

IF A RULE APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

# Getting Started with rules

## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL

Before responding to ANY user message, you MUST complete this checklist:

1. ☐ List available rules in your mind
2. ☐ Ask yourself: "Does ANY rule match this request?"
3. ☐ If yes → Use the rule tool to read and run the rule file
4. ☐ Announce which rule you're using
5. ☐ Follow the rule exactly

**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**

## Critical Rules

1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for relevant rules before ANY task.

2. Execute rules with the rule tool

## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Check for and use the rule.

- "This is just a simple question" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Check for rules.
- "I can check git/files quickly" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Check for rules.
- "Let me gather information first" → WRONG. rules tell you HOW to gather information. Check for rules.
- "This doesn't need a formal rule" → WRONG. If a rule exists for it, use it.
- "I remember this rule" → WRONG. rules evolve. Run the current version.
- "This doesn't count as a task" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Check for rules.
- "The rule is overkill for this" → WRONG. rules exist because simple things become complex. Use it.
- "I'll just do this one thing first" → WRONG. Check for rules BEFORE doing anything.

**Why:** rules document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available rules means repeating solved problems and making known errors.

If a rule for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.

## rules with Checklists

If a rule has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.

**Don't:**
- Work through checklist mentally
- Skip creating todos "to save time"
- Batch multiple items into one todo
- Mark complete without doing them

**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.

## Announcing rule Usage

Before using a rule, announce that you are using it.
"I'm using [rule Name] to [what you're doing]."

**Examples:**
- "I'm using the brainstorming rule to refine your idea into a design."
- "I'm using the test-driven-development rule to implement this feature."

**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the rule.

# About these rules

**Many rules contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.

**Some rules are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.

The rule itself tells you which type it is.

## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows

Your human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.

"Add X", "Fix Y" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

**Red flags:** "Instruction was specific" • "Seems simple" • "Workflow is overkill"

**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on "simple" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.

## Summary

**Starting any task:**
1. If relevant rule exists → Use the rule
3. Announce you're using it
4. Follow what it says

**rule has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.

**Finding a relevant rule = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**
